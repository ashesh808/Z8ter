# Z8ter.py

**Z8ter** is a lightweight, Laravel-inspired full-stack Python web framework built on [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/), designed for rapid development with tight integration between backend logic and frontend templates.

## âœ¨ Features (Current)

### 1. File-Based Routing
- Pages in the `views/` folder are automatically routed based on file name.
- Example: `views/about.py` â†’ `/about` route.
- Per-page logic with `.py` and `.jinja` template pairing.

### 2. Jinja2 Templating
- Integrated with Starletteâ€™s `Jinja2Templates`.
- Template inheritance with `{% extends %}` and `{% block %}`.
- Templates stored in `templates/` (default extension: `.jinja`).

Example:
```jinja
{% extends "components/base.jinja" %}
{% block content %}
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
{% endblock %}
````

### 3. CLI Tooling

* **`z8 create_page <name>`** â€” scaffolds a `.jinja` template and `.py` page class.
* Generates:

  ```
  templates/<name>.jinja
  views/<name>.py
  ```
* Template includes a basic `<h1>` with the page title.
* Page class renders the template via `Page.render()`.

Example:

```bash
z8 create_page about
```

Output:

```
âœ… Created template: templates/about.jinja
âœ… Created view: views/about.py
```

* Make creating interactive pages as fast as possible with minimal JS.
